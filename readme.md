# Create a new dev environment using devops tools 

I took this idea from the book [DevOps2.0](http://a.co/4DqpiDW) from [Victor Farcic](https://twitter.com/vfarcic) and the the [post devops-from-scratch](https://vtorosyan.github.io/ansible-docker-vagrant/) from Kevin London 

## Pre-requisites:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) installed.
- (optional) [Babun](http://babun.github.io/) 

You can clone this project and run the project just running `vagrant up`
